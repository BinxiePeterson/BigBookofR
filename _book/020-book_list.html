<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/roycoding">Roy Keyes</a></p>
<p>It’s quite possible that the only thing more confusing than defining data science is actually hiring data scientists. Hiring Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers is a concise, practical guide to cut through the confusion. Whether you’re the founder of a brand new startup, the senior vice president in charge of “digital transformation” at a global industrial company, the leader of a new analytics effort at a non-profit, or a junior manager of a machine learning team at a tech giant, this book will help walk you through the important questions you need to answer to determine what role and which skills you should hire for, how to source applicants, how to assess those applicants’ skills, and how to set your new hires up for success. Special emphasis is placed on in-office vs remote hiring situations.</p>

<p>by <a href="https://huyenchip.com/">Chip Huyen</a></p>
<p>This book is the result of the collective wisdom of many people who have sat on both sides of the table and who have spent a lot of time thinking about the hiring process. It was written with candidates in mind, but hiring managers who saw the early drafts told me that they found it helpful to learn how other companies are hiring, and to rethink their own process.</p>
<p>The book consists of two parts. The first part provides an overview of the machine learning interview process, what types of machine learning roles are available, what skills each role requires, what kinds of questions are often asked, and how to prepare for them. This part also explains the interviewers’ mindset and what kind of signals they look for.</p>
<p>The second part consists of over 200 knowledge questions, each noted with its level of difficulty – interviews for more senior roles should expect harder questions – that cover important concepts and common misconceptions in machine learning.</p>

<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/RohanAlexander">Rohan Alexander</a></p>
<p>This aim of this book is to help you learn how to tell stories with data. It establishes a foundation on which you can build and share knowledge, based on data, about an aspect of the world of interest to you.</p>
<p>In this book we explore, prod, push, manipulate, knead, and ultimately, try to understand the implications of, data. The motto of the university from which I took my PhD is ‘Naturam primum cognoscere rerum’ or roughly ‘first to learn the nature of things,’ and we will indeed attempt to do that. But the original quote continues ‘temporis aeterni quoniam,’ or roughly ‘for eternal time,’ and it is tools, approaches, and workflows that enable you to establish lasting knowledge that I focus on in this book.</p>

<p>by Ben Marwick (editor)</p>
<p>Archaeological science is becoming increasingly complex, and progress in this area is slowed by critical limitation of journal articles lacking the space to communicate new methods in enough detail to allow others to reproduce and reuse new research. One solution to this is to use a programming language such as R to analyse archaeological data, with authors sharing their R code with their publications to communicate our methods. This practice is becoming widespread in many other disciplines, but few archaeologists currently know how to use R or have an opportunity to learn during their training. In this forum we tackle this problem by discussing ubiquitous research methods of immediate relevance to most archaeologists, by using interactive, live-coded demonstrations of R code by archaeologists who program with R. Topics include getting data into R, working with C14 dates, spatial analysis and map-making, conducting simulations, and exploratory data visualizations.</p>

<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/meghansharris">Megan Harris</a></p>
<p>Recently I’ve discovered the courage to dive into creative coding and generative aRt in R. Something that the R community calls “Rtistry.” My Rtistry journey so far has been an amazing and tranquil expedition into a world that seemed intimidating and scary on the outside but is honestly just a bottomless pit of fun and creativity on the inside.</p>
<p>I’m going to talk about some very basic concepts and perspectives you can think about while starting your own Rtistry journey in ggplot. This includes basics on geoms, aesthetics, layering, etc. But then I’m also going to walk you through two of my Rtistry examples and code to get you started.</p>
<p>This article is intended for those who have some experience with ggplot building in R but may not have realized how to transition from making “regular” visuals to Rtistry. This article goes over basic concepts that more seasoned users may already know.</p>

<p>by Benjamin S. Baumer, Daniel T. Kaplan, Nicholas J. Horton</p>
<p>This book is intended for readers who want to develop the appropriate skills to tackle complex data science projects and “think with data” (as coined by Diane Lambert of Google). The desire to solve problems using data is at the heart of our approach.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that it is impossible to cover all these topics in any level of detail within a single book: Many of the chapters could productively form the basis for a course or series of courses. Instead, our goal is to lay a foundation for analysis of real-world data and to ensure that analysts see the power of statistics and data analysis. After reading this book, readers will have greatly expanded their skill set for working with these data, and should have a newfound confidence about their ability to learn new technologies on-the-fly.</p>
<p>This book was originally conceived to support a one-semester, 13-week undergraduate course in data science. We have found that the book will be useful for more advanced students in related disciplines, or analysts who want to bolster their data science skills. At the same time, Part I of the book is accessible to a general audience with no programming or statistics experience.</p>

<p>This book will teach you how to do data science with R: You’ll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it. In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we aim to provide a practical introduction to data visualisation using R, specifically aimed at researchers who have little to no prior experience of using R. First we detail the rationale for using R for data visualisation and introduce the “grammar of graphics” that underlies data visualisation using the ggplot package. The tutorial then walks the reader through how to replicate plots that are commonly available in point-and-click software such as histograms and boxplots, as well as showing how the code for these “basic” plots can be easily extended to less commonly available options such as violin-boxplots.</p>

<p>by Jack Dougherty, Ilya Ilyankou</p>
<p>(Oscar: looks like am amazing resource and includes code templates!)</p>
<p>In this book, you’ll learn how to create true and meaningful data visualizations through chapters that blend design principles and step-by-step tutorials, in order to make your information-based analysis and arguments more insightful and compelling. Just as sentences become more persuasive with supporting evidence and source notes, your data-driven writing becomes more powerful when paired with appropriate tables, charts, or maps. Words tell us stories, but visualizations show us data stories by transforming quantitative, relational, or spatial patterns into images. When visualizations are well-designed, they draw our attention to what is most important in the data in ways that would be difficult to communicate through text alone.</p>

<p>by Hadley Wickham</p>
<p>ggplot2 is an R package for producing statistical, or data, graphics. Unlike most other graphics packages, ggplot2 has an underlying grammar, based on the Grammar of Graphics (Wilkinson 2005), that allows you to compose graphs by combining independent components. This makes ggplot2 powerful. Rather than being limited to sets of pre-defined graphics, you can create novel graphics that are tailored to your specific problem.</p>

<p>by Greg Wilson</p>
<p>Years ago, Patrick Burns wrote The R Inferno, a guide to R for those who think they are in hell. Upon first encountering the language after two decades of using Python, I thought Burns was an optimist—after all, hell has rules.</p>
<p>I have since realized that R does too, and that they are no more confusing or contradictory than those of other programming languages. They only appear so because R draws on a tradition unfamiliar to those of us raised with derivatives of C. Counting from one, copying data rather than modifying it, lazy evaluation: to quote the other bard, these are not mad, just differently sane.</p>
<p>Welcome, then, to a universe where the strange will become familiar, and everything familiar, strange. Welcome, thrice welcome, to R.</p>

<p>by <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/kieran-marray-866740134">Kieran Marray</a></p>
<p>This is a short introduction to R to go with the first year econometrics courses at the Tinbergen Institute. It is aimed at people who are relatively new to R, or programming in general. The goal is to give you enough of knowledge of the fundamentals of R to write and adapt code to fit econometric models to data, and to simulate your own data, working alone or with others. You will be able to: read data from csv files, plot it, manipulate it into the form you want, use sets of functions others have built (packages), write your own functions to compute estimators, simulate data to test the performance of estimators, and present the results in a nice format.</p>
<p>Most importantly, when things inevitably go wrong, you will be able to begin to interpret error messages and adapt others’ solutions to fit your needs.</p>

<p>Over the past years I’ve received a lot of messages asking what I considered to be the most important subjects one should learn in order to start a career in economic research. R for Economic Research is my contribution to those who have some knowledge of R programming but still lack the necessary tools to carry out professional economic analysis. This is an intermediate-level book where the reader will find shortcuts to start working on a variety of tasks and also valuable references to delve into the details of more complex topics.</p>

<p>by <a href="https://magesblog.com">Markus Gesmann</a>, Jake Morris</p>
<p>Hierarchical compartmental reserving models provide a parametric framework for describing aggregate insurance claims processes using differential equations. We discuss how these models can be specified in a fully Bayesian modeling framework to jointly fit paid and outstanding claims development data, taking into account the random nature of claims and underlying latent process parameters. We demonstrate how modelers can utilize their expertise to describe specific development features and incorporate prior knowledge into parameter estimation. We also explore the subtle yet important difference between modeling incremental and cumulative claims payments. Finally, we discuss parameter variation across multiple dimensions and introduce an approach to incorporate market cycle data such as rate changes into the modeling process. Examples and case studies are shown using the probabilistic programming language Stan via the brms package in R.</p>

<p>by Christoph Hanck, Martin Arnold, Alexander Gerber, Martin Schmelzer</p>
<p>Beginners with little background in statistics and econometrics often have a hard time understanding the benefits of having programming skills for learning and applying Econometrics. Introduction to Econometrics with R is an interactive companion to the well-received textbook Introduction to Econometrics by James H. Stock and Mark W. Watson (2015). It gives a gentle introduction to the essentials of R programming and guides students in implementing the empirical applications presented throughout the textbook using the newly acquired skills. This is supported by interactive programming exercises and integration of interactive visualizations of central concepts which are based on the flexible JavaScript library D3.js.</p>

<p>by <a href="https://ryanpeek.org/">Ryan Peek</a>, <a href="https://www.richpauloo.com/">Rich Pauloo</a></p>
<p>Consists of 2 courses</p>
<p>Introductory: This course is most relevant and targeted at folks who work with data, from analysts and program staff to engineers and scientists. This course provides an introduction to the power and possibility of a reproducible programming language (R) by demonstrating how to import, explore, visualize, analyze, and communicate different types of data. Using water resources based examples, this course guides participants through basic data science skills and strategies for continued learning and use of R.</p>
<p>Intermediate: In this course, we will move more quickly, assume familiarity with basic R skills, and also assume that the participant has working experience with more complex workflows, operations, and code-bases. Each module in this course functions as a “stand-alone” lesson, and can be read linearly, or out of order according to your needs and interests. Each module doesn’t necessarily require familiarity with the previous module.</p>
<p>This course emphasizes intermediate scripting skills like iteration, functional programming, writing functions, and controlling project workflows for better reproducibility and efficiency. Approaches to working with more complex data structures like lists and timeseries data, the fundamentals of building Shiny Apps, pulling water resources data from APIs, intermediate mapmaking and spatial data processing, integrating version control in projects with git.</p>

This Coursera course is based on the Summer 2013 offering of my University of Washington advanced undergraduate economics course of the same name. At the time, my UW course was part of a three course summer certificate in Fundamentals of Quantitative Finance offered by the Professional Masters Program in Computational Finance &amp; Risk Management that was video-recorded and available for online students. An edited version of this course became the Coursera course. The popularity of the course encouraged me to convert the class notes for the course into a short book.</p>

<p>Financial economics is a vibrant area of research, a central part of all businesses activities, and at least implicitly relevant for our everyday life. Despite its relevance for our society and a vast number of empirical studies of financial phenomenons, one quickly learns that the actual implementation is typically rather opaque.</p>
<p>This book aims to lift the curtain on reproducible finance by providing a fully transparent code base for many common financial applications. We hope to inspire others to share their code publicly and take part in our journey towards more reproducible research in the future.</p>

<p>by <a href="https://www.robinlovelace.net/">Robin Lovelace</a>, <a href="https://directory.unamur.be/staff/modumont">Morgane Dumont</a></p>
<p>Imagine a world in which data on companies, households and governments were widely available. Imagine, further, that researchers and decision-makers acting in the public interest had tools enabling them to test and model such data to explore different scenarios of the future. People would be able to make more informed decisions, based on the best available evidence. In this technocratic dreamland pressing problems such as climate change, inequality and poor human health could be solved.</p>
<p>These are the types of real-world issues that we hope the methods in this book will help to address. Spatial microsimulation can provide new insights into complex problems and, ultimately, lead to better decision-making. By shedding new light on existing information, the methods can help shift decision-making processes away from ideological bias and towards evidence-based policy.</p>

<p>by Gilberto Camara, Rolf Simoes, Felipe Souza, Alber Sanchez, Lorena Santos, et al</p>
<p>Using time series derived from big Earth Observation data sets is one of the leading research trends in Land Use Science and Remote Sensing. One of the more promising uses of satellite time series is its application to classify land use and land cover. Information on land is critical for sustainable development because our growing demand for natural resources is causing significant environmental impacts. The target audience for sits is the new generation of specialists who understand the principles of remote sensing and can write scripts in R. Ideally, users should have basic knowledge of data science methods using R.</p>
<p>This book presents sits, an open-source R package for land use and land cover classification using big Earth observation data.</p>

<p>by Mark Banghart</p>
<p>The R and Python communities have developed a set of tools in the tidyverse and the pandas packages respectively designed to wrangle table data. The intuitive nature of these packages makes learning to use them easy and the code easy to read and understand. These tools allow researchers to quickly and accurately complete data preparation for a wide variety of analysis. It is the application of these packages and their approaches to wrangling that are the subject of this book.</p>
<p>The Data Wrangling Essentials title was chosen to emphasize both the use of these new tools and the importance of the work of gathering and preparing data.</p>

<p>Handling character strings in R? Wait a second… you exclaim, R is not a scripting language like Perl, Python, or Ruby. Why would you want to use R for handling and processing text? Well, because sooner or later (I would say sooner than later) you will have to deal with some kind of string manipulation for your data analysis. So it’s better to be prepared for such tasks and know how to perform them inside the R environment.</p>

<p>Data Carpentry’s aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain. The lessons below were designed for those interested in working with ecology data in R.</p>
<p>This is an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming experience. These lessons can be taught in a day (~ 6 hours). They start with some basic information about R syntax, the RStudio interface, and move through how to import CSV files, the structure of data frames, how to deal with factors, how to add/remove rows and columns, how to calculate summary statistics from a data frame, and a brief introduction to plotting. The last lesson demonstrates how to work with databases directly from R.</p>
<p>This lesson assumes no prior knowledge of R or RStudio and no programming experience.</p>

<p>by Daniel Chen, Anne Brown</p>
<p>We hope this book provides a gentle introduction to data science. The main goal is to understand how to work with spreadsheet data and how data can be manipulated for multiple purposes. If nothing else, the book hopes to help you plan how to structure your own datasets for your own analysis. Even if you never go on to program on your own, understanding the way data can be manipulated and having a plan for your own dataset in the processing pipeline, will go a long ways when leaning and doing the analysis on your own, and/or working with collegues and collaborators on a project.</p>

<p>by Stanley E. Lazic</p>
<p>This practical guide shows biologists how to design reproducible experiments that have low bias, high precision, and results that are widely applicable. With specific examples using both cell cultures and model organisms, it shows how to plan a successful experiment. It demonstrates how to control biological and technical factors that can introduce bias or add noise, and covers rarely discussed topics such as graphical data exploration, choosing outcome variables, data quality control checks, and data pre-processing. It also shows how to use R for analysis, and is designed for those with no prior experience. This is an ideal guide for anyone conducting lab-based biological research.</p>

<p>This book is divided into two parts. First, I cover how to process, manipulate, and operate on data in R. Second, I cover basic PHDS from an epidemiologic perspective. Data science is “the art and science of transforming data into actionable knowledge.” Here is where we can build on the strengths of epidemiology (descriptive and analytic studies). However, in public health practice we need much more than this.</p>

<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/ewenharrison">Ewen Harrison</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/_Riinu_">Riinu Pius</a></p>
<p>In this age of information, the manipulation, analysis and interpretation of data have become a fundamental part of professional life. Nowhere more so than in the delivery of healthcare. From the understanding of disease and the development of new treatments, to the diagnosis and management of individual patients, the use of data and technology are now an integral part of the business of healthcare.</p>
<p>Those working in healthcare interact daily with data, often without realising it. The conversion of this avalanche of information to useful knowledge is essential for high-quality patient care. An important part of this information revolution is the opportunity for everybody to become involved in data analysis. This democratisation is driven in part by the open source software movement – no longer do we require expensive specialised software to do this.</p>
<p>The statistical programming language, R, is firmly at the heart of this.</p>
<p>This book will take an individual with little or no experience in data science all the way through to the execution of sophisticated analyses. We emphasise the importance of truly understanding the underlying data with liberal use of plotting, rather than relying on opaque and possibly poorly understood statistical tests. There are numerous examples included that can be adapted for your own data, together with our own R packages with easy-to-use functions.</p>

<p>by Peter D.R. Higgins, MD, PhD, MSc</p>
<p>This is a book for anyone in the medical field interested in analyzing the data available to them to better understand health, disease, or the delivery of care. This could include nurses, dieticians, psychologists, and PhDs in related fields, as well as medical students, residents, fellows, or doctors in practice. I expect that most learners will be using this book in their spare time at night and on weekends, as the health training curricula are already packed full of information, and there is no room to add skills in reproducible research to the standard curriculum. This book is designed for self-teaching, and many hints and solutions will be provided to avoid roadblocks and frustration. Many learners find themselves wanting to develop reproducible research skills after they have finished their training, and after they have become comfortable with their clinical role. This is the time when they identify and want to address problems faced by patients in their practice with the data they have before them. This book is for you.</p>

<p>Progressively more and more attention has been paid to how location affects health outcomes. The area of disease mapping focusses on these problems, and the Bayesian paradigm has a major role to play in the understanding of the complex interplay of context and individual predisposition in such studies of disease. Using R for Bayesian Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Health Modeling provides a major resource for those interested in applying Bayesian methodology in small area health data studies.</p>

<p>This book illustrates a method of using the traditional deep learning-based multi-class classification techniques to hide messages in a matrix of seemingly random numbers. This book is definitely a niche topic and is more of a fun project than something you would want to do for work. The premise is that you can represent characters as a sequence of random numbers you uniquely generate, and with the help of a neural network, a message can be embedded in a matrix of numbers. In the book, I also describe how this method can be used to embed messages in images.</p>

<p>by Michael Harris</p>
<p>I wrote this book for people who primarily use other statistical software like SPSS or SAS, and want to get started in deep learning with Keras. With this idea in mind, a sizable chuck of the book is giving people the prerequisite information they need to start using Keras. I start from the very beginning of assigning variables and end with multi-class classification with deep learning models.</p>

<p>Modeling as a statistical practice can encompass a wide variety of activities. This book focuses on supervised or predictive modeling for text, using text data to make predictions about the world around us. We use the tidymodels framework for modeling, a consistent and flexible collection of R packages developed to encourage good statistical practice.</p>

<p>by Gilberto Camara, Rolf Simoes, Felipe Souza, Alber Sanchez, Lorena Santos, et al</p>
<p>Using time series derived from big Earth Observation data sets is one of the leading research trends in Land Use Science and Remote Sensing. One of the more promising uses of satellite time series is its application to classify land use and land cover. Information on land is critical for sustainable development because our growing demand for natural resources is causing significant environmental impacts. The target audience for sits is the new generation of specialists who understand the principles of remote sensing and can write scripts in R. Ideally, users should have basic knowledge of data science methods using R.</p>
<p>This book presents sits, an open-source R package for land use and land cover classification using big Earth observation data.</p>

<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/dr_keithmcnulty">Keith McNulty</a></p>
<p>The technology of graphs is all around us, and enables so many of the ways in which we live our lives today. That same technology is also available to us at no cost as an analytic tool to allow us to better understand network structures and dynamics in the fields of science, technology, economics, sociology and psychology to name just a few. It is available to academics and practitioners alike, and can be used on problems ranging from a very small network analysis which takes a few minutes on a laptop, to massive scale network mining requiring days or weeks of processing time.</p>
<p>But here’s the problem: few people really know how to do network analysis. It is still considered by many as a deep specialism or even a ‘dark art.’ It shouldn’t be.</p>
<p>This book aims to make the field of graph and network analysis more approachable to students and professionals by explaining the most important elements of theory and sharing common methodologies using open source programming languages like R and Python. It does so by explaining theory in as much detail as is necessary to support analytical curiosity and interpretation, and by using a wide array of example data sets and code snippets to demonstrate the specific implementation and interpretation of methodologies.</p>

<p>Rcpp is a package that enables you to implement R functions in C++. It is easy to use even without deep knowledge of C++, because it is implemented so as to write your C++ code in a style similar to R. And Rcpp does not sacrifice execution speed for the ease of use, anyone can get high performance outcome.</p>
<p>This document focuses on providing necessary information to users who are not familiar with C++. Therefore, in some cases, I explain usage of Rcpp conceptually rather than describing accurately from the viewpoint of C++, so that I hope readers can easily understand it.</p>

<p>by Hadley Wickham</p>
<p>ggplot2 is an R package for producing statistical, or data, graphics. Unlike most other graphics packages, ggplot2 has an underlying grammar, based on the Grammar of Graphics (Wilkinson 2005), that allows you to compose graphs by combining independent components. This makes ggplot2 powerful. Rather than being limited to sets of pre-defined graphics, you can create novel graphics that are tailored to your specific problem.</p>

<p>by Chester Ismay, Albert Y. Kim, Hendrik Feddersen</p>
<p>The intention of this book is to encourage more ‘data driven’ decisions in HR. HR Analytics is not anymore a nice-to-have addon but rather the way HR practitioners should conduct HR decision making in the future. Where applicable, human judgement is ‘added’ onto a rigorous analysis of the data done in the first place.</p>
<p>To achieve this ideal world, I need to equip you with some fundamental knowledge of R and RStudio, which are open-source tools for data scientists. I am well aware that on one side you want to do something for your career in HR, however you are most likely completely new to coding.</p>

<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/dr_keithmcnulty">Keith McNulty</a></p>
<p>The technology of graphs is all around us, and enables so many of the ways in which we live our lives today. That same technology is also available to us at no cost as an analytic tool to allow us to better understand network structures and dynamics in the fields of science, technology, economics, sociology and psychology to name just a few. It is available to academics and practitioners alike, and can be used on problems ranging from a very small network analysis which takes a few minutes on a laptop, to massive scale network mining requiring days or weeks of processing time.</p>
<p>But here’s the problem: few people really know how to do network analysis. It is still considered by many as a deep specialism or even a ‘dark art.’ It shouldn’t be.</p>
<p>This book aims to make the field of graph and network analysis more approachable to students and professionals by explaining the most important elements of theory and sharing common methodologies using open source programming languages like R and Python. It does so by explaining theory in as much detail as is necessary to support analytical curiosity and interpretation, and by using a wide array of example data sets and code snippets to demonstrate the specific implementation and interpretation of methodologies.</p>

<p>by David E. Caughlin</p>
<p>The foundation of HR analytics formed over a century ago with the emergence of disciplines like industrial and organizational (I/O) psychology. In recent decades, advances in information technology and systems have reduced the time HR professionals spend on transactional and administrative activities, thereby creating more time and opportunity for transformational activities supporting the realization of strategic organizational objectives. HR analytics has the potential to play an integral role in such transformational activities, as it can inform HR system design</p>

<p>A Survivor’s Guide to R provides a gentle yet thorough introduction to R. The book is structured around critical R tasks, and focuses on applied knowledge, rather than abstract concepts. The book’s easy-to-read approach helps students with little or no background in statistics or programming to develop real-world R skills through straightforward coverage of R objects and functions. Focusing on real-world data, the challenges of dataset construction, and the use of R’s powerful graphing tools, the guide is written in an accessible and sympathetic style that ensures students acquire functional R skills they can use in their own projects and carry into their work beyond the classroom. A Survivor’s Guide to R focusses on the challenges of learning R, rather than learning statistics. This makes it an effective complement for those who are using other statistics texts, or who already have a statistics background.</p>

<p>The aim of this book is to introduce you to using R, a powerful and flexible interactive environment for statistical computing and research. R in itself is not difficult to learn, but as with learning any new language (spoken or computer) the initial learning curve can be a little steep and somewhat daunting. We have tried to simplify the content of this book as much as possible and have based it on our own personal experience of teaching (and learning) R over the last 15 years. It is not intended to cover everything there is to know about R - that would be an impossible task. Neither is it intended to be an introductory statistics course, although you will be using some simple statistics to highlight some of R’s capabilities. The main aim of this book is to help you climb the initial learning curve and provide you with the basic skills and experience (and confidence!) to enable you to further your experience in using R.</p>

<p>There has been considerable debate over choosing R vs.&nbsp;Python for Data Science. Based on my limited knowledge/experience, both R and Python are great languages and are worth learning; so why not learn them together?</p>
<p>Besides the side-by-side comparison of the two popular languages used in Data Science, this book also focuses on the translation from mathematical models to codes. In the book, the audience could find the applications/implementations of some important algorithms from scratch, such as maximum likelihood estimation, inversion sampling, copula simulation, simulated annealing, bootstrapping, linear regression (lasso/ridge regression), logistic regression, gradient boosting trees, etc.</p>

The concept for a recipe card is that they are self contained, providing all the ingredients, preparation, and instructions required to create a meal. While a cookbook may consist of many recipes, there is no expectation to read, understand, and master all the recipes in order to prepare a meal. Following this as the central theme the book, it has been designed as a number of data analytics recipes focusing on the R language.</p>

<p>Gain an accelerated introduction to domain-specific languages in R, including coverage of regular expressions. This compact, in-depth book shows you how DSLs are programming languages specialized for a particular purpose, as opposed to general purpose programming languages. Along the way, you’ll learn to specify tasks you want to do in a precise way and achieve programming goals within a domain-specific context.</p>
<p>Domain-Specific Languages in R includes examples of DSLs including large data sets or matrix multiplication; pattern matching DSLs for application in computer vision; and DSLs for continuous time Markov chains and their applications in data science. After reading and using this book, you’ll understand how to write DSLs in R and have skills you can extrapolate to other programming languages.</p>

<p>by Mark Sellors</p>
<p>This field guide aims to introduce the reader to the main components of the R ecosystem that may be encountered in “the field”.Whatever the reason, whilst there is a wealth of in-depth information for people actually using the language, I could find precious little information that provided the sort of overview of the ecosystem that I know I’d have appreciated when I first came to the language. And with that thought, a field guide is born…</p>

<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/ThomasMailund">Thomas Mailund</a></p>
<p>Get an introduction to functional data structures using R and write more effective code and gain performance for your programs. This book teaches you workarounds because data in functional languages is not mutable: for example you’ll learn how to change variable-value bindings by modifying environments, which can be exploited to emulate pointers and implement traditional data structures. You’ll also see how, by abandoning traditional data structures, you can manipulate structures by building new versions rather than modifying them. You’ll discover how these so-called functional data structures are different from the traditional data structures you might know, but are worth understanding to do serious algorithmic programming in a functional language such as R.</p>

<p>This document provides a concise introduction to R. It emphasizes what you need to know to be able to use the language in any context. There is no fancy statistical analysis here. We just present the basics of the R language itself. We do not assume that you have done any computer programming before (but we do assume that you think it is about time you did). Experienced R users obviously need not read this. But the material may be useful if you want to refresh your memory, if you have not used R much, or if you feel confused.</p>

<p>by Bruno Rodrigues</p>
<p>This book can be useful to different audiences. If you have never used R in your life, and want to start, start with Chapter 1 of this book. Chapter 1 to 3 are the very basics, and should be easy to follow up to Chapter 9. Starting with Chapter 9, it gets more technical, and will be harder to follow. But I suggest you keep on going, and do not hesitate to contact me for help if you struggle! Chapter 9 is also where you can start if you are already familiar with R and the {tidyverse}, but not functional programming. If you are familiar with R but not the {tidyverse} (or have no clue what the {tidyverse} is), then you can start with Chapter 4. If you are familiar with R, the {tidyverse} and functional programming, you might still be interested in this book, especially Chapter 9 and 10, which deal with package development and further advanced topics respectively.</p>

<p>by Y. Wendy Huynh</p>
<p>Hello! My name is Wendy Huynh and I am a current PhD student working in the behavioral neurosciences. I began my R journey at the end of my first year of graduate school, slowly and painfully piecing together code. Although programming was never really part of my program, I now see it as an integral part of my work.</p>
<p>Many fellow graduate students expressed interest in learning R, but didn’t know where to begin. Programming with R is still relatively niche among my cohort and there are very few formal classes teaching this subject.</p>
<p>Although there are many amazing guides/textbooks for R out there, very few of them featured examples relevant for my specific needs and were user-friendly enough for a true beginner. In the Fall of my second year, I began teaching a new graduate student in my lab everything I knew about R. However, I quickly found that teaching R – even just to one person – was very time consuming. I decided to write up assignments as a “short” guide to R. After writing a short 11 page “first assignment” and receiving positive feedback, I began writing up a second assignment. Then a third. Soon enough, I had written enough pages that I couldn’t deny that this “short guide” had turned into a book.</p>

<p>Rcpp is a package that enables you to implement R functions in C++. It is easy to use even without deep knowledge of C++, because it is implemented so as to write your C++ code in a style similar to R. And Rcpp does not sacrifice execution speed for the ease of use, anyone can get high performance outcome.</p>
<p>This document focuses on providing necessary information to users who are not familiar with C++. Therefore, in some cases, I explain usage of Rcpp conceptually rather than describing accurately from the viewpoint of C++, so that I hope readers can easily understand it.</p>

<p>This course introduces a powerful set of data science tools known as the Tidyverse. The Tidyverse has revolutionized the way in which data scientists do almost every aspect of their job. We will cover the simple idea of “tidy data” and how this idea serves to organize data for analysis and modeling. We will also cover how non-tidy data can be transformed to tidy data, the data science project life cycle, and the ecosystem of Tidyverse R packages that can be used to execute a data science project.</p>

<p>Learn R from the ground up.</p>
<p>Let me make something very, very clear…</p>
<p>I did not write this book.</p>
<p>This whole story started in the Summer of 2015. I was taking a late night swim on the Bodensee in Konstanz and saw a rusty object sticking out of the water. Upon digging it out, I realized it was an ancient usb-stick with the word YaRrr inscribed on the side. Intrigued, I brought it home and plugged it into my laptop. Inside the stick, I found a single pdf file written entirely in pirate-speak. After watching several pirate movies, I learned enough pirate-speak to begin translating the text to English. Sure enough, the book turned out to be an introduction to R called The Pirate’s Guide to R.</p>

<p>‘bookdownplus’ is an extension of ‘bookdown’. It is a collection of multiple templates, which I have been collecting since years ago on the basis of LaTeX, and have been tailoring them so that I can work happily under the umbrella of ‘bookdown’. ‘bookdownplus’ helps you (and me) write varied types of books and documents. This book you are reading at the moment was exactly produced by ‘bookdownplus’.</p>

<p>Census data are widely used in the United States across numerous research and applied fields, including education, business, journalism, and many others. Until recently, the process of working with US Census data has required the use of a wide array of web interfaces and software platforms to prepare, map, and present data products. The goal of this book is to illustrate the utility of the R programming language for handling these tasks, allowing Census data users to manage their projects in a single computing environment.</p>

<p>My goal for this book is to take the lessons I’ve learned teaching statistics to a diverse and often cursorily trained group of students who have problems they care about, that they need to bring demographic data to bear upon. This is a challenge, and I have always been a stalwart proponent of teaching statistics and data analysis in a very applied manner. As such, this book won’t be going into rigorous proofs of estimators or devoting pages to expositions of icky algebra; instead it will focus on exploring modern methods of data analysis that in used by demographers every day, but not always taught in our training programs.</p>

<p>by <a href="https://www.bluefoxdata.eu/">William Becker</a></p>
<p>Composite indicators are aggregations of indicators which aim to measure (usually socio-economic) complex and multidimensional concepts which are difficult to define, and cannot be measured directly. Examples include innovation, human development, environmental performance, and so on. This book gives a detailed guide on building composite indicators in R, focusing on the recent COINr package, which is an end-to-end development environment for composite indicators. Although COINr is the main tool used in the book, it also gives general explanation and guidance on composite indicator construction and analysis in R, ranging from normalisation, aggregation, multivariate analysis and global sensitivity analysis.</p>

<p>by <a href="https://bensoltoff.com/">Dr.&nbsp;Benjamin Soltoff</a></p>
<p>The goal of this course is to teach you basic computational skills and provide you with the means to learn what you need to know for your own research. I start from the perspective that you want to analyze data, and programming is a means to that end. You will not become an expert programmer - that is a given. But you will learn the basic skills and techniques necessary to conduct computational social science, and gain the confidence necessary to learn new techniques as you encounter them in your research.</p>
<p>We will cover many different topics in this course, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elementary programming techniques (e.g.&nbsp;loops, conditional statements, functions)</li>
<li>Writing reusable, interpretable code</li>

<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/JacobKaplanCrim">Jacob Kaplan</a></p>
<p>This book introduces the programming language R and is meant for undergrads or graduate students studying criminology. R is a programming language that is well-suited to the type of work frequently done in criminology - taking messy data and turning it into useful information. While R is a useful tool for many fields of study, this book focuses on the skills criminologists should know and uses crime data for the example data sets.</p>

<p>by Quan Li</p>
<p>This book seeks to teach undergraduate and graduate students in social sciences how to use R to manage, visualize, and analyze data in order to answer substantive questions and replicate published findings. This book distinguishes itself from other introductory R or statistics books in three ways. First, targeting an audience rarely exposed to statistical programming, it adopts a minimalist approach and covers only the most important functions and skills in R that one will need for conducting reproducible research projects. Second, it emphasizes meeting the practical needs of students using R in research projects. Specifically, it teaches students how to import, inspect, and manage data; understand the logic of statistical inference; visualize data and findings via histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and diagnostic plots; and analyze data using one-sample t-test, difference-of-means test, covariance, correlation, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, and model assumption diagnostics. Third, it teaches students how to replicate the findings in published journal articles and diagnose model assumption violations.</p>

<p>by Jerry Bean</p>
<p>Our goal for this document is to illustrate the importance of good data analysis practices and how R and companion packages support these practices. We think the R system has many benefits for social work research. R has become the flagship computing environment for many areas of science and has great appeal because it is free and open-access. In addition, free tools like RStudio and R Markdown promote a replication commitment and open science philosophy important to our work.</p>

<p>we will focus on statistical inference, the process of using data analysis to draw conclusions about a population or process beyond the existing data. “Traditional” hypothesis tests and confidence intervals that you are familiar with are components of “frequestist” statistics. This book will introduce aspects of “Bayesian” statistics. We will focus on analyzing data, developing models, drawing conclusions, and communicating results from a Bayesian perspective. We will also discuss some similarities and differences between frequentist and Bayesian approaches, and some advantages and disadvantages of each approach.</p>

<p>by Paul Roback, Julie Legler</p>
<p>This book is designed for undergraduate students who have successfully completed a multiple linear regression course, helping them develop an expanded modeling toolkit that includes non-normal responses and correlated structure. Even though there is no mathematical prerequisite, the authors still introduce fairly sophisticated topics such as likelihood theory, zero-inflated Poisson, and parametric bootstrapping in an intuitive and applied manner. The case studies and exercises feature real data and real research questions; thus, most of the data in the textbook comes from collaborative research conducted by the authors and their students, or from student projects. Every chapter features a variety of conceptual exercises, guided exercises, and open-ended exercises using real data. After working through this material, students will develop an expanded toolkit and a greater appreciation for the wider world of data and statistical modeling.</p>

<p>by Scott Cunningham</p>
<p>Causal inference encompasses the tools that allow social scientists to determine what causes what. In a messy world, causal inference is what helps establish the causes and effects of the actions being studied—for example, the impact (or lack thereof) of increases in the minimum wage on employment, the effects of early childhood education on incarceration later in life, or the influence on economic growth of introducing malaria nets in developing regions. Scott Cunningham introduces students and practitioners to the methods necessary to arrive at meaningful answers to the questions of causation, using a range of modeling techniques and coding instructions for both the R and the Stata programming languages.</p>

<p>by Steve Doogue</p>
<p>This is a reworking of the book Common statistical tests are linear models (or: how to teach stats), written by Jonas Lindeløv. The book beautifully demonstrates how many common statistical tests (such as the t-test, ANOVA and chi-squared) are special cases of the linear model. The book also demonstrates that many non-parametric tests, which are needed when certain test assumptions do not hold, can be approximated by linear models using the rank of values.</p>

<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/speegled">Darrin Speegle</a>, Bryan Clair</p>
<p>This book represents a fundamental rethinking of a calculus based first course in probability and statistics. We offer a breadth first approach, where the fundamentals of probability and statistics can be taught in one semester. The statistical programming language R plays an essential role throughout the text through simulations, data wrangling, visualizations and statistical procedures. Data sets from a variety of sources, including many from recent, open source scientific articles, are used in examples and exercises. Demonstrations of important facts are given through simulations, with some formal mathematical proofs as well.</p>
<p>This book is an excellent choice for students studying data science, statistics, engineering, computer science, mathematics, science, business, or any field which requires the two semesters of calculus needed to read this book.</p>

<p>Learning Statistics with R covers the contents of an introductory statistics class, as typically taught to undergraduate psychology students, focusing on the use of the R statistical software. The book discusses how to get started in R as well as giving an introduction to data manipulation and writing scripts. From a statistical perspective, the book discusses descriptive statistics and graphing ﬁrst, followed by chapters on probability theory, sampling and estimation, and null hypothesis testing. After introducing the theory, the book covers the analysis of contingency tables, t-tests, ANOVAs and regression. Bayesian statistics are covered at the end of the book.</p>

<p>In short, LOST is a Rosetta Stone for statistical software.</p>
<p>LOST is a publicly-editable website with the goal of making it easy to execute statistical techniques in statistical software.</p>
<p>Each page of the website contains a statistical technique — which may be an estimation method, a data manipulation or cleaning method, a method for presenting or visualizing results, or any of the other kinds of things that statistical software typically does.</p>
<p>For each of those techniques, the LOST page will contain code for performing that method in a variety of packages and languages. It may also contain information (or links) with thorough descriptions of the method, but the focus here is on implementation. How can you do it in your language of choice? If there are multiple ways, how are those ways different? Is the way you used to do it outdated, or does it do something unexpected? What’s the R equivalent of that command you know about in Stata or SAS, or vice versa?</p>

<p>The code was collected over several years, so is not exactly consistent in style, but now has been cleaned up to make it more so. Within each demo, you will generally find some imported/simulated data, a primary estimating function, a comparison of results with some R package, and a link to the old code that was the initial demonstration.</p>

It is a fairly thorough treatment of graphical and inferential evaluation of one-factor designs. It presumes prior background coverage of the ANOVA logic from standard textbooks such as Howell or Maxwell, Delaney and Kelley (2017). The analyses are intended to parallel and exhaust the methods already covered with SPSS, and to extend them to additional topics.</p>

<p>The goal of Superpower is to easily simulate factorial designs and empirically calculate power using a simulation approach. The R package is intended to be utilized for prospective (a priori) power analysis. Calculating post hoc power is not a useful thing to do for single studies.</p>
<p>This package, and book, expect readers to have some familiarity with R (2020). However, we have created two Shiny apps (for the ANOVA_power &amp; ANOVA_exact functions respectively) to help use Superpower if you are not familiar with R. Reading through the examples in this book, and reproducing them in the Shiny apps, is probably the easiest way to get started with power analyses in Superpower.</p>

<p>Many textbooks on regression focus on theory and the simplest of examples. Real statistical problems, however, are complex and subtle. This is not a book about the theory of regression. It is a book about how to use regression to solve real problems of comparison, estimation, prediction, and causal inference. It focuses on practical issues such as sample size and missing data and a wide range of goals and techniques. It jumps right in to methods and computer code you can use fresh out of the box.</p>

<p>We live in a complex world, and clever people are continually coming up with new ways to observe and record increasingly large parts of it so we can comprehend it better (warts and all!). We are squarely in the midst of a “big data” era, and it seems that every day new methodologies and algorithms emerge that are designed to deal with the ever-increasing size of these data streams. It so happens that the “big data” available to us are often spatio-temporal data. That is, they can be indexed by spatial locations and time stamps. This book provides an accessible introduction, with hands-on applications of the methods through the use of R Labs at the end of each chapter.</p>

<p>by A Solomon Kurz</p>
<p>This ebook is based on the second edition of Richard McElreath’s (2020) text, Statistical rethinking: A Bayesian course with examples in R and Stan. My contributions show how to fit the models he covered with Paul Bürkner’s brms package, which makes it easy to fit Bayesian regression models in R using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. I also prefer plotting and data wrangling with the packages from the tidyverse. So we’ll be using those methods, too.</p>

<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/nickchk">Nick Huntington-Klein</a></p>
<p>The Effect is a book intended to introduce students (and non-students) to the concepts of research design and causality in the context of observational data. The book is written in an intuitive and approachable way and doesn’t overload on technical detail. Why teach regression and research design at the same time when they are fundamentally different things? First learn why you want to structure a design in a certain way, and what it is you want to do to the data, and then afterwards learn the technical details of how to run the appropriate model.</p>

<p>by Gaston Sanchez</p>
<p>The main motivating trigger behind this book has been my long standing obsession to understand the historical development of Partial Least Squares methods in order to find the who’s, why’s, what’s, when’s, and how’s. It is the result of an intermittent 10 year quest, tracking bits and pieces of information in order to assemble the story of such methods. Moreover, this text is my third iteration on the subject, following two of my previous works.</p>

<p>by Andrew B. Lawson</p>
<p>Progressively more and more attention has been paid to how location affects health outcomes. The area of disease mapping focusses on these problems, and the Bayesian paradigm has a major role to play in the understanding of the complex interplay of context and individual predisposition in such studies of disease. Using R for Bayesian Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Health Modeling provides a major resource for those interested in applying Bayesian methodology in small area health data studies.</p>

<p>by Greg Wilson</p>
<p>(Oscar’s note: Not an R book per se, but comes highly recommended about how to teach programming.)</p>
<p>Grassroots groups have sprung up around the world to teach programming, web design, robotics, and other skills to free-range learners. These groups exist so that people don’t have to learn these things on their own, but ironically, their founders and teachers are often teaching themselves how to teach.</p>
<p>There’s a better way. Just as knowing a few basic facts about germs and nutrition can help you stay healthy, knowing a few things about cognitive psychology, instructional design, inclusivity, and community organization can help you be a more effective teacher. This book presents key ideas you can use right now, explains why we believe they are true, and points you at other resources that will help you go further</p>

<p>Dealing with text is typically not even considered in the applied statistical training of most disciplines. This is in direct contrast with how often it has to be dealt with prior to more common analysis, or how interesting it might be to have text be the focus of analysis. This document and corresponding workshop will aim to provide a sense of the things one can do with text, and the sorts of analyses that might be useful.</p>

<p>by Robert H. Shumway, David S. Stoffer</p>
<p>The book is designed as a textbook for graduate level students in the physical, biological, and social sciences and as a graduate level text in statistics. Some parts may also serve as an undergraduate introductory course. Theory and methodology are separated to allow presentations on different levels. In addition to coverage of classical methods of time series regression, ARIMA models, spectral analysis and state-space models, the text includes modern developments including categorical time series analysis, multivariate spectral methods, long memory series, nonlinear models, resampling techniques, GARCH models, ARMAX models, stochastic volatility, wavelets, and Markov chain Monte Carlo integration methods.</p>

<p>A quick beginner’s guide to using Git and GitHub.You have heard about git and GitHub and want to know what the buzz is about. That is what I am here to tell you. Or, at least, I am here to give you a quick overview of what you can do with git and GitHub. I won’t be able, in the space here, to give you an exhaustive list of features—in all honesty, I don’t know enough myself to be able to claim expertise with these tools. I am only a frequent user, but I can get you started and give you some pointers for where to learn more. That is what this booklet is for.</p>

<p>by Edwin Thoen</p>
<p>I joined a Scrum team (frontend, backend, ux designer, product owner, second data scientist) to create a machine learning model that we brought to production using the Agile principles. It was an inspiring experience from which I learned a great deal. My colleagues patiently explained the principles of Agile software development and together we applied them to the data science context.All these experiences culminated in the workflow that we now adhere to at work and I think it is worthwhile to share it. It is heavily based on the principles of Agile software production, hence the title. We have explored which of the concepts from Agile did and did not work for data science and we got hands-on experience in working from these principles in an R project that actually got to production.</p>

<p>by Crystal Lewis</p>
<p>This book begins, like many other books in this subject area, by describing the research life cycle and how data management fits within the larger picture. The remaining chapters are then organized by each phase of the life cycle, with examples of best practices provided for each phase. Considerations on whether you should implement, and how to integrate those practices into your workflow will be discussed.</p>

<p>by David Keyes</p>
<p>There are many great learning resources at the beginner stage and some incredible tutorials to master complex tasks in R. But, drawing from a concept in urban planning, there are far fewer resources in the middle. Stretching the metaphor perhaps to its breaking point, new R users at the “detached single-family home” stage can’t get to the advanced “mid-rise” level without going through the middle stage. The “missing middle” in the R neighborhood is the lack of resources to that answer the types of nuts and bolts questions that new R users often have.</p>
<p>Things like:</p>
<p>How should I organize my file structure when creating a new project? Should I do data cleaning in an RMarkdown file or an R script file? How do I find packages? How do I know if the packages I find are high quality?</p>
<p>This book is my attempt to provide answers to these types of questions.</p>

<p>by Bruno Rodrigues</p>
<p>This course is my take on setting up code that results in some data product. This code has to be reproducible, documented and production ready. Not my original idea, but introduced by the UK’s Analysis Function.</p>
<p>The basic idea of a reproducible analytical pipeline (RAP) is to have code that always produces the same result when run, whatever this result might be. This is obviously crucial in research and science, but this is also the case in businesses that deal with data science/data-driven decision making etc.</p>
<p>A well documented RAP avoids a lot of headache and is usually re-usable for other projects as well.</p>

<p>The targets package is a Make-like pipeline toolkit for Statistics and data science in R. With targets, you can maintain a reproducible workflow without repeating yourself. targets learns how your pipeline fits together, skips costly runtime for tasks that are already up to date, runs only the necessary computation, supports implicit parallel computing, abstracts files as R objects, and shows tangible evidence that the results match the underlying code and data.</p>

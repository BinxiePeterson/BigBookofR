If you’re like me, you can’t help but bookmark every R-related programming book you find in the hopes that one day you, or someone you know, might find it useful. Hopefully this is the only bookmark you’ll need in future ;). When I initially released this collection in late August 2020, it contained about 100 books that I’d been collecting over the previous two years. Since then I’ve found a few more and there have been contributions from many people. The collection now stands at over 300 books. Most of these are free. Some are paid but usually quite affordable. 1.2 Searching If there’s something specific you’re looking for, use the menu or search using the magnifying glass icon at the top of the screen. 1.3 Supporting If you’d like to show your appreciation with a donation you’re most welcome to do so here: 1.4 Contributing Please feel free to contribute paid and free books - see GitHub. or submit via the Google Form. 1.5 Contributors If you’ve contributed, add your name and Twitter / blog link below!

I’m guessing that if you’re interested in R then you also like data ;). Note that “unique” visits will be higher in Plausible than you’d find with Google Analytics. Because Plausible is GDPR compliant and privacy focused, each user is identified for only 1 day. If someone visits the site 2 days in a row, that’s counted as 2 “uniques” whereas in Google Analytics it would only be counted as 1 unique visitor because of the presence of persistent cookies and such that allows for tracking of users. From now on, you can view the LIVE site stats right here. 1.8 About me I’m Oscar. If you like this book, feel free to say “Hi!” on Mastodon or LinkedIn.
